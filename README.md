# Ghostbusters Ghost Guesser

Slimer themed guessing game written in OOP. Revolves around the Ghostbusters firehouse in New York and Slimerâ€™s love of food.
The player guesses the number of restaurants that are being haunted by Slimer and his otherworldly friends within two city blocks 
of the Ghostbusters firehouse. The game tells the player whether each guess is too high, too low, or just right. For every wrong 
guess, the game slowly fades away until it completely disappears like a ghost. Desktop, tablet, and mobile responsive.
